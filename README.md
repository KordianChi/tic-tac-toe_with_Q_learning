# tic-tac-toe_with_Q_learning
## Introduction

This project aims to apply Q-learning algorithm in a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is implemented using Python programming language, and the Q-learning algorithm is used to train a model that can make optimal moves in the game. The project includes several functions for playing the game, such as a function for generating all possible moves, a function for updating the Q-table, and a function for selecting the best move based on the current state of the game. This project is a learning exercise and serves as a starting point for more advanced projects in the field of reinforcement learning.
