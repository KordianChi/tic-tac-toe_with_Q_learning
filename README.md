# tic-tac-toe_with_Q_learning
## Introduction

This project aims to apply Q-learning algorithm in a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is implemented using Python programming language, and the Q-learning algorithm is used to train a model that can make optimal moves in the game. The project includes several functions for playing the game, such as a function for generating all possible moves, a function for updating the Q-table, and a function for selecting the best move based on the current state of the game. This project is a learning exercise and serves as a starting point for more advanced projects in the field of reinforcement learning.

This project involves using Q-learning in a tic-tac-toe game and testing the possibility of using a neural network to reproduce the Q-table based on a smaller number of games. The project serves as an exercise before taking on more advanced challenges in the field of reinforcement learning.

To test the effectiveness of the neural network, the Q-table generated from a long game (50,000) will be compared with the D-table generated from a short series of games (500). The test involves playing games with a random player, a player using a naive strategy, and between themselves. In each case, both algorithms will play 10,000 games as both O and X.
